# TO-DO-list
The To-Do List App lets you efficiently manage your tasks with ease. Add and edit tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when done. A key feature is the ability to toggle the visibility of completed tasks, helping you keep your list organized and focused. To get started, simply clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and launch the app using npm start.
